# Top Up Pull Payment 

The top up billing model allows a customer to subscribe to a service

### Use Case
A business wants to allow for their customers to pay using Top-Up.

In the Top-Up, it is specified that when the credits that the user holds drops below 25 credits, an automatic payment should happen to top-up the account to the initial amount, for example 100 credits.
We have the initial payment amount that the user has to pay to get the 100 credits, for example 10$. At this point the user has 100 credits that he can start spending on ImLive.
The rest of the payments will be different since the customer will need to buy 75 credits i.e. 7.5$.
Top-Up allows ImLive to withdraw funds from the customer wallet whenever needed i.e. when the customerâ€™s credit balance drops to 25 credits.
The customer should be able to specify some limits in regards to how much he is willing to spend on a time-period basis (daily, weekly, hourly etc). 
These limits can be specified either through number of transactions or amount or both i.e. whatever limit is reached first.
At the same time, he should be able to specify the same limits for the amount that the merchant can pull from their account in total.
